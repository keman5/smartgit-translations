ttpTagGroupingGroupPatterns"Refs will be categorized into groups: when traversing the repository root log, refs will first be assigned to matching groups. Every group will store only the most recently encountered ref, i.e. if a new ref is encountered, it will replace all existing refs in the current group.\n\nNext, the refs remaining in the group will be passed on from child to parent commit. Now, once again they will be assigned to matching groups, possibly replacing other refs or possibly becoming replaced by more recent refs.\n\nPatterns will be matched against the full ref-name, including the <tt>refs</tt>-prefix. For a matching ref, its name will be shortened to the last path-segment \('\\/'\). For example, <tt>refs/tags/build-.\*</tt> will match a tag <tt>refs/tags/build-123</tt> and its name will be shortened to <tt>build-123</tt>. You may add a <i>named regex capturing group</i> called <tt>name</tt> to further customize the name extraction. For example, <tt>refs/tags/build-\(?&lt;name&gt;.\*\)</tt> will match <tt>refs/tags/build-123</tt> and its name will be shortened to <tt>123</tt>.\n\nYou can assign a title to a pattern by prefixing it by <tt>title:</tt>; the title may only contain letters, digits and '_'.\n\nYou can specify multiple groups patterns, separated by comma \(<tt>,</tt>\), which will be processed in the specified order: if you define two groups which both match a set of refs, such refs will be assigned to the first group.\n\nExample: <tt>build:refs/tags/build\(?&lt;name&gt;.\*\),version:refs/tags/\\d+\\.\\d+\\..\*</tt>"=\
